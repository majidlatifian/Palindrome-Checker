# Palindrome Checker

This code checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward.

## Usage

1. Enter a string.
2. The program will convert the string to lowercase and reverse it.
3. If the reversed string is the same as the original string, the program will print "palindrome".
4. If the reversed string is different from the original string, the program will print "not palindrome".

## Example
```

Input:
level
```
```
Output:
palindrome
```
